			<p><center> Hello! My name is Tristan. 
				I am a young adult, recentely entered into the college level of my education. I am doing three A-Levels, in Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science,
				currently predicted to achieve an A* in each. I have had a passion for computers, in particular how code can create new, modify pre-existing or entirely rebuild the way a system will run,
				whether that be in a basic application, a simple standalone script or in video games. I also have a strong passion for archery, and plan on being a casual Archer for the definitive future!
